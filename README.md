- Display the following weather information: - Current temperature - Weather description (e.g., sunny, cloudy, etc.) - Humidity - Wind speed - Any other relevant weather information you think is important
- Display appropriate weather icons or images based on the weather condition.
- Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages if the API request fails or if the location is not found.
- Add any additional features or enhancements that you think would improve the application.
